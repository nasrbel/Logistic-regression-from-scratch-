# Logistic-regression-from-scratch
'Logistic regression analysis studies the association between a categorical dependent variable Y and a set of independent (explanatory) variables. The name logistic regression is used when the dependent variable has only two values, such as 0 and 1 or Yes and No. The name multinomial logistic regression is usually reserved for the case when the dependent variable has three or more unique values, such as Married, Single, Divored, or Widowed. Although the type of data used for the dependent variable is different from that of multiple regression, the practical use of the procedure is similar.' Source : NCSS Statistical Software. In this project we use the Iris dataset imported from Sklearn in python. We aim to classify the flowers on two clusters by coding the logistic regression algorithm from scratch using python.
